""""""""""""" My cscope/vim key mappings
    "
    " The following maps all invoke one of the following cscope search types:
    "
    "   's'   symbol: find all references to the token under cursor
    "   'g'   global: find global definition(s) of the token under cursor
    "   'c'   calls:  find all calls to the function name under cursor
    "   't'   text:   find all instances of the text under cursor
    "   'e'   egrep:  egrep search for the word under cursor
    "   'f'   file:   open the filename under cursor
    "   'i'   includes: find files that include the filename under cursor
    "   'd'   called: find functions that function under cursor calls
    "
    " Below are three sets of the maps: one set that just jumps to your
    " search result, one that splits the existing vim window horizontally and
    " diplays your search result in the new window, and one that does the same
    " thing, but does a vertical split instead (vim 6 only).
    "
    " I've used CTRL-\ and CTRL-@ as the starting keys for these maps, as it's
    " unlikely that you need their default mappings (CTRL-\'s default use is
    " as part of CTRL-\ CTRL-N typemap, which basically just does the same
    " thing as hitting 'escape': CTRL-@ doesn't seem to have any default use).
    " If you don't like using 'CTRL-@' or CTRL-\, , you can change some or all
    " of these maps to use other keys.  One likely candidate is 'CTRL-_'
    " (which also maps to CTRL-/, which is easier to type).  By default it is
    " used to switch between Hebrew and English keyboard mode.
    "
    " All of the maps involving the <cfile> macro use '^<cfile>$': this is so
    " that searches over '#include <time.h>" return only references to
    " 'time.h', and not 'sys/time.h', etc. (by default cscope will return all
    " files that contain 'time.h' as part of their name).


    " To do the first type of search, hit 'CTRL-\', followed by one of the
    " cscope search types above (s,g,c,t,e,f,i,d).  The result of your cscope
    " search will be displayed in the current window.  You can use CTRL-T to
    " go back to where you were before the search.

    " By default Vim will only wait 1 second for each keystroke in a mapping.
